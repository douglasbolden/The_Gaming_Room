# The_Gaming_Room
Portfolio Addition for CS-230
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, is a fictitious Gaming Company that wanted the developer, myself, to design a game that could be deployed on multiple platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that my code is well documented, well commented, and robust. I believe the most professional quality item I produced was the FULL UML diagram.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Just getting the real world experience was the most helpful to me. Knowing that I can take away more than just reading a document, and knowing that I will be able to apply it in a multitude of situations.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would most likely try to make the code more compact. It would be a lot more simple if their were less files to work with.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I used the information that was given to me in order to build a view of the "Whole Picture." This whole picture showed me exactly what was needed and what they truly wanted. This is something that I have done for as long as I could remember. I was once told by a previous professor of mine that a good developer can see the whole picture, not just a piece. To be able to mold a new piece that fits perfectly is what we are striving for as developers.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I did research. Learning what must be done is crucial to the work that I will perform as a developer. The best technique is learning how to interpret what is going to happen, how it is going to happen, and WHERE it is going to happen. You can write programs all day long, but knowing what happens to your variable during it's entire life cycle is more important. If it changes half way, and you don't see it happen, it is a complete failure in the end EVEN THOUGH it does indeed produce something.
